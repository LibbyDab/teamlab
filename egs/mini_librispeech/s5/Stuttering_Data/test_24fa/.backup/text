24fa_1	I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY AFFECTED MY ENTIRE LIFE
24fa_10	HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW I'M ASSUMING IT'S SOMETHING GENETIC
24fa_11	I DON'T REMEMBER THE WHEN I FIRST STARTED STUTTERING I JUST REMEMBER HAVING ISSUES WITH IT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
24fa_12	SO I DON'T KNOW IF I STARTED STUTTERING EARLIER THAN THAT BUT PROBABLY SOMETHING GENETIC
24fa_13	CAN I SAY LIKE WHERE I GOT THERAPY
24fa_14	OKAY SO ALL THROUGHOUT SCHOOL UM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL
24fa_15	WELL ASSUMING I STARTED STUTTERING IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT ALL THROUGHOUT LIKE MY SCHOOL DAYS
24fa_16	I WENT TO SPEECH THERAPY UM IN SCHOOL
24fa_17	AND I WAS WORKING ON FLUENCY SHAPING TECHNIQUES
24fa_18	WHICH WERE VERY HELPFUL LIKE IN THE SESSION WHERE IT WAS ONE ON ONE UM IN A QUIET ROOM NO DISTRACTIONS
24fa_19	BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY HELP ME IN LIKE THE REAL WORLD WHERE I WAS WITH LIKE A GROUP OF FRIENDS OR AT WORK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT SO
24fa_2	UP UNTIL LAST YEAR I WAS A COVERT STUTTERER
24fa_20	I BECAME MORE COVERT AND DIDN'T REALLY USE THOSE UM TECHNIQUES
24fa_21	UNLESS I WAS LIKE DOING A PRESENTATION WHERE AGAIN IT WAS JUST ME TALKING
24fa_22	UM AND THEN I WENT TO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR STUTTERING
24fa_23	AND I WAS WORKING ON DESENSITIZATION AND LETTING MY STUTTER SHOW SO THAT'S BEEN THE MOST HELPFUL
24fa_24	IT'S MADE ME FEEL LIKE MORE AUTHENTIC
24fa_25	SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION TO ME MEANS JUST SAYING WHATEVER I WANNA SAY UM
24fa_26	FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I WOULD JUST NOT SAY ANYTHING OR AVOID CERTAIN WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA STUTTER ON THEM
24fa_27	SO I GUESS THAT'S IT REALLY JUST SAYING WHAT I WANNA SAY AND NOW AFTER GOING TO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR STUTTERING
24fa_28	SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION FOR ME WOULD BE TO OPENLY STUTTER AND SAYING EVERYTHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
24fa_29	OH AND THEN AN EXPERIENCE THAT I CHOOSE I DON'T KNOW UM
24fa_3	SO I WOULD NEVER INTRODUCE MYSELF TO PEOPLE I WOULDN'T PARTICIPATE IN CLASS
24fa_30	I ACTUALLY WAS AT THE MALL LAST WEEK SURVEYING PEOPLE
24fa_31	UM ASKING THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT STUTTERING
24fa_32	AND I WAS TALKING TO ONE GUY WHO KEPT FINISHING MY SENTENCES FOR ME
24fa_33	BUT EVEN THOUGH HE DID THAT I LIKE FINISHED MY SENTENCE WHILE HE WAS FINISHING MINE
24fa_34	SO I GUESS THAT WAS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE I DIDN'T LET HIM STOP ME FROM STUTTERING MY WAY THROUGH LIKE TILL THE END OF THE SENTENCE
24fa_35	SO MANY THINGS UM
24fa_36	I DON'T KNOW THAT'S HARD TO SAY I FEEL LIKE AFTER GOING TO THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR STUTTERING I HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK AS OPPOSED TO WHEN I WAS COVERT
24fa_37	SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT'S TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFESTYLES BUT
24fa_38	BUT BEFORE AIS I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT I COULD PROBABLY GET LIKE A BETTER JOB UM
24fa_39	LIKE BE LAWYER OR I DON'T KNOW A DOCTOR OR A TEACHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TALK A LOT
24fa_4	WHENEVER A TEACHER ASKED ME A QUESTION I WOULD JUST SAY I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THAT WAS EASIER THAN ASKING OR EASIER THAN ANSWERING THE QUESTION
24fa_40	OR I COULD LIKE HAVE MORE FRIENDS OR BE MORE OUTGOING AND ALL THESE THINGS UM
24fa_41	BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS EVEN THOUGH I STUTTER AND IT KIND OF GIVES ME MORE MOTIVATION BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE
24fa_42	THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT SOMEONE WHO STUTTERS LIKE CAN'T DO CERTAIN THINGS SO NOW I'M IN LIKE A BETTER MINDSET I GUESS TO PROVE PEOPLE WRONG
24fa_43	I WOULD SAY TO DEFINITELY CHECKOUT LIKE THE NATIONAL STUTTERING ASSOCIATION AND FRIENDS THE ORGANIZATION FOR KIDS AND TEENS WHO STUTTER
24fa_44	AND JUST ANY UM LIKE SUPPORT GROUP THAT EMPOWERS LIKE KIDS AND TEENS AND ADULTS WHO STUTTER AND JUST
24fa_45	MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT LIKE STUTTERING DOESN'T HAVE TO HOLD THEM BACK AND LIKE IT'S OKAY TO STUTTER IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO BE FIXED
24fa_46	AND I DON'T THINK THE GOAL SHOULD BE FLUENCY I THINK IT SHOULD JUST BE I MEAN I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CLIENT WANTS BUT
24fa_47	LIKE WHEN I WAS IN SPEECH THERAPY I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE CHOICE LIKE I WAS TOLD THAT STUTTERING IS BAD AND I SHOULDN'T STUTTER
24fa_48	I NEED TO SPEAK FLUENTLY AND IT JUST GAVE IT JUST PUT SO MUCH PRESSURE ON ME TO SPEAK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
24fa_49	AND LOOKING BACK ON IT THAT WAS NOT THE BEST THERAPY THAT I NEEDED
24fa_5	AND I DID NOT WANT MY CO NOT COWORKERS BUT CLASSMATES TO HEAR MY STUTTER UM
24fa_50	SO I WOULD JUST TRY TO EMPOWER YOUR CLIENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATORS
24fa_51	HOWEVER THEY WOULD LIKE THAT TO BE THAT SENTENCE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT OKAY
24fa_6	AND THEN I WENT TO I GOT DIFFERENT THERAPY LAST YEAR AND I'M STILL IN IT WHERE IT'S LIKE FOCUSED ON UM
24fa_7	DESENSITIZATION AND TRYING TO GET PAST THAT LIKE FEAR AND SHAME OF STUTTERING
24fa_8	SO I'M WORKING ON THAT AND NOW I'M GETTING A LITTLE BETTER AT INTRODUCING MYSELF AND LETTING MY STUTTER SHOW BUT I'M STILL LIKE AT WORK VERY QUIET
24fa_9	I START GRAD SCHOOL IN A COUPLE MONTHS SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF I PARTICIPATE MORE OR IF I LIKE FALL BACK INTO MY COVERT WAYSÂ BUT
