29mc_11	AND IN MY WORKPLACE AND COLLEGE I USE TO WORK AT TARGET AND I'VE HAD UH PROBLEMS WITH MANAGERS MAKING FUN OF MY STUTTERING UM
29mc_12	BUT THEN I GOT A CAMPUS JOB WHERE I HAD AN AMAZING MANAGER AND UM
29mc_13	AND THEN I NOW WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD WITH DOCTORS AND THAT'S BEEN AMAZING 'CAUSE THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND STUTTERING AND UM
29mc_14	AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE NOW FOR ME
29mc_15	UM THAT'S SO I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN STUTTERING I'M VERY MUCH ONLY A STUTTERER UM
29mc_16	I'VE HEARD IT'S UM BRAIN SOMETHING IN THE BRAIN UH
29mc_17	SOME I'VE ALSO HEARD LIKE CHEMICALS IN THE BODY UH UM
29mc_18	BUT I GUESS AS A STUTTERER FOR ME I KNOW WHAT CAUSES MY SEVERE STUTTERING PATTERNS AND THAT'S ANXIETY
29mc_19	AND UH KIND OF UM ANTICIPATION FOR WORDS THAT ARE COMING UP
29mc_2	SCHOOL ACTIVITIES UH PUBLIC ACTIVITIES UM
29mc_20	AND UM YEAH THAT'S IT
29mc_21	SO UH THERAPY STARTED WHEN I WAS LIKE FOUR YEARS OLD
29mc_22	MY MOM MADE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
29mc_23	TO UH HAVE ME START THERAPY UH
29mc_24	EVEN BEFORE I STARTED KINDERGARTEN
29mc_25	SO I WENT I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL THERAPY UP UNTIL MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN I
29mc_26	GAVE UP ON THE SCHOOL THERAPY AROUND NINTH GRADE WHEN I STARTED HIGH SCHOOL
29mc_27	UM AND THEN I ALSO WENT TO THE HOLLINS UH FLUENCY PROGRAM WHICH UH
29mc_28	IS A FLUENCY SHAPING UH PROGRAM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND UM
29mc_29	I THINK I GET MOST OF MY TECHNIQUES FROM WHAT THEY'VE TAUGHT ME AT HOLLINS WHICH IS UH STRESSED SYLLABLES
29mc_3	I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY OPEN WITH MY FAMILY UH AND FRIENDS
29mc_30	AND EASY ONSETS AND UM I THINK I USE THOSE UH NOT LIKE UNKNOWINGLY AND UM
29mc_31	I'M NOW LOOKING AT OTHER UH PROGRAMS WELL I RECENTLY
29mc_32	WENT TO A SPEECH THERAPIST THROUGH MY HEALTH INSURANCE AND KIND OF GOT OUT OF THAT AFTER A COUPLE OF APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST UH NOT WORTH MY TIME I'D SAY
29mc_33	AND UM I'M LOOKING AT VIVIAN SISSKIN'S PROGRAM FOR THE FUTURE SO
29mc_34	UH MAYBE SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION
29mc_35	I WOULD SAY UH FOR ME NOW SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION MEANS GETTING MY POINT ACROSS TO THE OTHER PERSON I'M COMMUNICATING WITH
29mc_36	UM LET'S SAY UH AT WORK I'M IN LIKE A MEETING UM
29mc_37	AND I NEED TO GET SOME TECHNICAL DETAIL OVER TO
29mc_38	OTHER MEMBERS OF MY TEAM TO JUST CONVEY SOME REQUIREMENT OF A DESIGN UM
29mc_39	UM OFTEN IT TAKES SKILL TO KIND OF UM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND TO KIND OF
29mc_4	BUT NOT ABOUT MY STUTTERING IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A TABOO LIKE TOPIC UM
29mc_40	CLARIFY THAT BACK SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH AND THEN
29mc_41	AFTER THE MEETING EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE LIKE I WOULD CONSIDER THAT A SUCCESSFUL UH COMMUNICATION UH
29mc_42	UH SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION UH THING
29mc_43	UM I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND IN OUR CHAPTER WE ALWAYS REVISIT THAT QUESTION
29mc_44	CAUSE IT'S INTERESTING I KIND OF GO BACK AND FORTH
29mc_45	AND I TRY TO NOW LOOK AT THE POSITIVES WHICH IS I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AS COMPASSIONATE IF I DIDN'T STUTTER
29mc_46	UM I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AS DEDICATED AND UM HAVE AS MUCH DRIVE UM IF I DIDN'T STUTTER UM
29mc_47	BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT I STILL THINK WOULD BE EASIER LIKE GROWING UP ESPECIALLY
29mc_48	UM I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HAD A BETTER TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL HAD BETTER GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL
29mc_49	AND UM FINISHED SCHOOL A LOT SOONER IF I WAS FLUENT
29mc_5	BUT UM RECENTLY UH I HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NSA AND UH
29mc_6	IT'S BEEN OPENING UP THIS NEW WORLD OF ACCEPTANCE TO ME UM
29mc_7	TO WHERE I NOW KIND OF PUT MYSELF OUT THERE MORE AND UM
29mc_8	DON'T LET THE FACT THAT I STUTTER KIND OF SHAPE THE WAY I AM UM
29mc_9	AND THEN UM TAKING A BIGGER PART IN THE NSA AS A CHAPTER LEADER HAS REALLY KIND OF PUSHED ME MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF ACCEPTANCE AND UH
