1,29mc,um historically my stuttering has uh prevented me or held me back in um
2,29mc,school activities uh public activities um 
3,29mc,I have always been pretty open with my family uh and friends 
4,29mc,but not about my stuttering it's always been a taboo like topic um
5,29mc,but um recently uh I have been part of the NSA and uh
6,29mc,it's been opening up this new world of acceptance to me um
7,29mc,to where I now kind of put myself out there more and um 
8,29mc,don't let the fact that I stutter kind of shape the way I am um 
9,29mc,and then um taking a bigger part in the NSA as a chapter leader has really kind of pushed me more in the direction of acceptance and uh
10,29mc,I've been seeing more uh less of a holdback um due to my stuttering um 
11,29mc,and in my workplace and college I use to work at Target and I've had uh problems with managers making fun of my stuttering um
12,29mc,but then I got a campus job where I had an amazing manager and um  
13,29mc,and then I now work in the healthcare field with doctors and that's been amazing 'cause they also understand stuttering and um
14,29mc,and it's been a great experience now for me 
15,29mc,um that's so I'm not an expert in stuttering I'm very much only a stutterer um
16,29mc,I've heard it's um brain something in the brain uh 
17,29mc,some I've also heard like chemicals in the body uh um
18,29mc,but I guess as a stutterer for me I know what causes my severe stuttering patterns and that's anxiety 
19,29mc,and uh kind of um anticipation for words that are coming up 
20,29mc,and um yeah that's it 
21,29mc,so uh therapy started when I was like four years old 
22,29mc,my mom made special arrangements with the elementary school 
23,29mc,to uh have me start therapy uh 
24,29mc,even before I started kindergarten 
25,29mc,so I went I've been in and out of school therapy up until middle school and then I  
26,29mc,gave up on the school therapy around ninth grade when I started high school 
27,29mc,um and then I also went to the Hollins uh Fluency Program which uh  
28,29mc,is a fluency shaping uh program in high school and um
29,29mc,I think I get most of my techniques from what they've taught me at Hollins which is uh stressed syllables 
30,29mc,and easy onsets and um I think I use those uh not like unknowingly and um
31,29mc,I'm now looking at other uh programs well I recently 
32,29mc,went to a speech therapist through my health insurance and kind of got out of that after a couple of appointments because it was just uh not worth my time I'd say 
33,29mc,and um I'm looking at Vivian Sisskin's program for the future so
34,29mc,uh maybe successful communication 
35,29mc,I would say uh for me now successful communication means getting my point across to the other person I'm communicating with 
36,29mc,um let's say uh at work I'm in like a meeting um
37,29mc,and I need to get some technical detail over to 
38,29mc,other members of my team to just convey some requirement of a design um
39,29mc,um often it takes skill to kind of um understand what they don't understand and to kind of  
40,29mc,clarify that back so if we are able to go back and forth and then 
41,29mc,after the meeting everyone's on the same page like I would consider that a successful uh communication uh
42,29mc,uh successful communication uh thing 
43,29mc,um I've often thought about that and in our chapter we always revisit that question 
44,29mc,cause it's interesting I kind of go back and forth 
45,29mc,and I try to now look at the positives which is I probably wouldn't be as compassionate if I didn't stutter 
46,29mc,um I probably wouldn't be as dedicated and um have as much drive um if I didn't stutter um
47,29mc,but then there are other things that I still think would be easier like growing up especially 
48,29mc,um I would probably have had a better time in high school had better grades in high school  
49,29mc,and um finished school a lot sooner if I was fluent 
50,29mc,and therefore probably be ahead of where I am now 'cause I think stuttering has put obstacles in my way 
51,29mc,but I focus on the positive now 
52,29mc,um I would say that everyone who I come across  
53,29mc,who asks me about my stutter I say I am not an expert in stuttering but uh  
54,29mc,all I ask is for you to give me time and and um
