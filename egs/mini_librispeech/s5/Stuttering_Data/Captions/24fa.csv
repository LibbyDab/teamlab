1,24fa,I mean it's definitely affected my entire life
2,24fa,up until last year I was a covert stutterer
3,24fa,so I would never introduce myself to people I wouldn't participate in class 
4,24fa,whenever a teacher asked me a question I would just say I don't know because that was easier than asking or easier than answering the question
5,24fa,and I did not want my co not coworkers but classmates to hear my stutter um
6,24fa,and then I went to I got different therapy last year and I'm still in it where it's like focused on um
7,24fa,desensitization and trying to get past that like fear and shame of stuttering 
8,24fa,so I'm working on that and now I'm getting a little better at introducing myself and letting my stutter show but I'm still like at work very quiet
9,24fa,I start grad school in a couple months so it will be interesting to see if I participate more or if I like fall back into my covert waysÂ but
10,24fa,honestly I don't know I'm assuming it's something genetic
11,24fa,I don't remember the when I first started stuttering I just remember having issues with it in middle school
12,24fa,so I don't know if I started stuttering earlier than that but probably something genetic
13,24fa,can I say like where I got therapy
14,24fa,okay so all throughout school um elementary school middle school 
15,24fa,well assuming I started stuttering in elementary school but all throughout like my school days
16,24fa,I went to speech therapy um in school
17,24fa,and I was working on fluency shaping techniques
18,24fa,which were very helpful like in the session where it was one on one um in a quiet room no distractions
19,24fa,but it didn't really help me in like the real world where I was with like a group of friends or at work you know it's not like a controlled environment so
20,24fa,I became more covert and didn't really use those um techniques
21,24fa,unless I was like doing a presentation where again it was just me talking
22,24fa,um and then I went to the American Institute For Stuttering
23,24fa,and I was working on desensitization and letting my stutter show so that's been the most helpful
24,24fa,it's made me feel like more authentic
25,24fa,successful communication to me means just saying whatever I wanna say um
26,24fa,for most of my life I would just not say anything or avoid certain words because I didn't wanna stutter on them
27,24fa,so I guess that's it really just saying what I wanna say and now after going to the American Institute For Stuttering
28,24fa,successful communication for me would be to openly stutter and saying everything that I would like to say
29,24fa,oh and then an experience that I choose I don't know um
30,24fa,I actually was at the mall last week surveying people
31,24fa,um asking them questions about stuttering
32,24fa,and I was talking to one guy who kept finishing my sentences for me
33,24fa,but even though he did that I like finished my sentence while he was finishing mine
34,24fa,so I guess that was pretty successful because I didn't let him stop me from stuttering my way through like till the end of the sentence
35,24fa,so many things um
36,24fa,I don't know that's hard to say I feel like after going to the American Institute For Stuttering I have a different outlook as opposed to when I was covert
37,24fa,so I don't really know how to answer these questions because I feel like it's two different kind of lifestyles but
38,24fa,but before AIS I would have said that I could probably get like a better job um
39,24fa,like be lawyer or I don't know a doctor or a teacher because they have to talk a lot
40,24fa,or I could like have more friends or be more outgoing and all these things um
41,24fa,but now I feel like I can do all these things even though I stutter and it kind of gives me more motivation because I know people  
42,24fa,there are people who think that someone who stutters like can't do certain things so now I'm in like a better mindset I guess to prove people wrong
43,24fa,I would say to definitely checkout like the National Stuttering Association and Friends the organization for kids and teens who stutter
44,24fa,and just any um like support group that empowers like kids and teens and adults who stutter and just
45,24fa,make sure that people know that like stuttering doesn't have to hold them back and like it's okay to stutter it's not something that necessarily needs to be fixed
46,24fa,and I don't think the goal should be fluency I think it should just be I mean I guess it depends on what the client wants but
47,24fa,like when I was in speech therapy I didn't really have choice like I was told that stuttering is bad and I shouldn't stutter
48,24fa,I need to speak fluently and it just gave it just put so much pressure on me to speak like everybody else
49,24fa,and looking back on it that was not the best therapy that I needed
50,24fa,so I would just try to empower your clients to be successful communicators
51,24fa,however they would like that to be that sentence doesn't make sense but okay
