There's a boy that's sitting on the ground looking at his pet dog, small dog. He's built that dog a doghouse and there's scraps of lumber around so it just looks like it's been recently built. It's made out of plywood. It's got a red roof. The dog is sitting next to its water bowl, and there's also a playball on the other side of the boy. The boy is about eight years old. He's holding this hammer in his hand contemplating the dog. He's wearing a yellow t-shirt and blue denim pants.
