There's a mother doing the dishes. She doesn't notice behind her are her two children who have snuck into the children and are commandeering cookies out of a cookie jar that's on the second shelf of cupboard. To get those cookies, a young boy has climbed onto a ladder. He's helping his sister who is waiting for the cookies down below. She doesn't appear to know or care that the stool is slipping from underneath him. The mother's got the window open. It is a lovely spring day. And she fails to notice that the tap water is running over onto her kitchen floor.
